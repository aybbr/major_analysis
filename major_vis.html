				DJ Khaled has recently dropped his ninth studio album featuring 34 of the rap game biggest names. From from Jay Z, Nas, J. Cole, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Big Sean, 2 Chainz, Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, Chris Brown, August Alsina, Jeremih, Future, Betty Wright, Bryson Tiller, Kodak Black, Jeezy, French Montana, Yo Gotti, YG, Gucci Mane, Jadakiss, Fabolous, Busta Rhymes, Fat Joe,Kent Jones, Wale, Wiz Khalifa, Lil Wayne, Mavado to the american Pop singer, Meghan Trainor. This particular album has yield unprecedented success. Khaled's voiced presence is only limited to those motivational "special talks" and most of his tracks are what they are thanks to his guests.
				I made an analysis that reviews every singer lyrics to determine which words and phrases are distinct for each rapper that you can find here.
				Based on Nadieh Bremer's <a href="http://www.visualcinnamon.com/portfolio/words-lord-of-the-rings">project</a>, I did this visualization below to illustrate the total words sung per singer and per track.
